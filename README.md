# hacked-a11y-fix
I built my personal website way back in 2006. It was hacked within a few weeks. The hackers replaced my website with a message. Unfortunately, the [website the hackers have built](https://web.archive.org/web/20081008222424/http://www.necrid.eu/) wasn't really accessible. 

I decided to make it more accessible myself, almost two decades later. 

You can find the result here: https://niqwithq.github.io/hacked-a11y-fix/

Feel free to make it eeven more accessible.
